        <h2>Why Mariposa?</h2>
        <h3>Creativity and Exploration</h3>
        <p>The MARIPOSA curriculum offers learning materials and activities designed toexcite and motivate young children. Whether investigating the properties of water, the wonders of music, or creating unique art with found objects, children have the opportunity to explore, learn, express themselves, and interact with their peers in a warm and encouraging classroom setting.</p>

        <h3>A Focus on Character</h3>
        <p>At MARIPOSA learning nurtures both the mind and the heart. While we emphasize the various practical skills that children learn in the classroom, modeling and teaching respect, kindness, and responsibility is a lifestyle at MARIPOSA.</p>

        <h3>Socialization Matters</h3>
        <p>The development of language and social skills is a vital component of the MARIPOSA curriculum. We focus not only on the development of skills needed for speech, reading, and writing, but also on learning to communicate and interact in a respectful and polite manner.</p>

        <h3>Spanish Immersion</h3>
        <p>MARIPOSA offers children an education taught in both Spanish and English. The linguistic, cognitive, and lifelong benefits of learning a second language at a young age are well documented, revealing that people who are fluent in more than one language have an advantage in the workplace and develop a deeper understanding of their own and other cultures.</p>

        <h3>Child Development Experts</h3>
        <p>At MARIPOSA we hire experienced, creative, and highly regarded early childhood educators whose primary goal is to support and nurture the well being of every child. In addition to the Montessori approach to education, we use both long standing philosophies of education, combined with current best practices in the field of early education and care.</p>

        <h3>NURTURING CHILDHOOD</h3>
        <p>Respecting, accepting, and supporting the special qualities of everychild is the essence of the MARIPOSA approach. We want every child to enjoy being a child; to explore, learn, and play with joy and enthusiasm; and to become responsible, caring adults.</p>

        <h3>EMBRACING FAMILIES</h3>
        <p>At MARIPOSA we offer a supportive and welcoming learning environment for all families navigating the world of parenthood. From a stimulating early childhood library and bookstore to on-site workshops and coaching, parents are empowered to deepen their understanding of child development and how they can contribute to their childâ€™s cognitive, physical, and social-emotional well being.</p>

        <h3>HONORING CULTURES</h3>
        <p>At MARIPOSA we believe that ethnic, cultural, and linguistic diversity enriches our lives. We respect and appreciate similarities and differences. We are mindful that our school environment reflects many perspectives and cultures - from the families that join us to the members of our staff, to the lesson plans and materials we incorporate in the classroom.</p>
