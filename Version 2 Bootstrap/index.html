          <p>Respecting, accepting, and supporting the special qualities of every child is the essence of the MARIPOSA approach. We want every child to enjoy being a child; to explore, learn, and play with joy and enthusiasm; and to become responsible, caring adults.</p>

          <h2>EMBRACING FAMILIES</h2>
          <p>At MARIPOSA we offer a supportive and welcoming learning environment for all families navigating the world of parenthood. From a stimulating early childhood library and bookstore to on-site workshops and coaching, parents are empowered to deepen their understanding of child development and how they can contribute to their childâ€™s cognitive, physical, and social-emotional well being.</p>

We are mindful that our school environment reflects many perspectives and cultures - from the families that join us to the members of our staff, to the lesson plans and materials we incorporate in the classroom.</p>
